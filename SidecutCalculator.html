    <p>If you'd like to know more about the math behind this, see <a href="http://alpinesnowboarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Physics-of-a-Snowboard-Carved-Turn.pdf">Physics of a carved snowboard turn</a>.
        <br>For even more math, check out <a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/168379/1/carving.pdf">Balanced carving turns in alpine skiing.</a>
        <br>If you find yourself thinking that sidecut depth and effective edge length matter more than sidecut radius, see Appendix A of that second paper. Spoiler: The math works out the same.
    </p>

    <p>If you think that Howe's cosine formula isn't accurate for carve radius calculations, check out this quote from the 2nd paper:
        <blockquote>
            ...in the field study of turns performed by members of the Norwegian national team, Reid, Haugen, Gilgien, Kipp, and Smith (2020) found a good agreement with equation (33) up to Ψ ≃ 70◦
        </blockquote>
    <br>"Equation 33" is that cosine formula, and Ψ is just the edge angle.

    <div style="max-width:500px">
    <p>If you're not into physics and math, here's some stuff to think about...</p>

    <p><b>Obvious</b></p>
    
    <p>For a given edge angle, a board with a shorter sidecut radius will (as you might expect) carve a tighter turn than a board with a longer sidecut radius.</p>

    <p>For a given sidecut radius and carve radius, there is only one edge angle that will make that board carve that radius. </p>

    <p>You can't carve a turn whose radius is larger than your board's sidecut radius. You can follow the path of such a turn, but you'll be skidding, not carving.</p>
    
    <p>If you ride a few boards with different radii, you'll find that shorter radius boards ride best at lower speeds, and larger radius boards ride best at higher speeds. 
    <ul>
        <li>Shorter radius boards carve tighter paths, so the faster you go, the more awkward it gets to make tight turns - it's just easier to skid instead. 
        <li>Longer radius boards carve larger-radius paths, so the slower you go, the more awkward that gets - it's just easier to skid instead.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>So, if you're having trouble carving at higher speeds - or if you find yourself subconsciously slowing down before you start carving - a larger sidecut radius might be for you.</p>
    
    <p><b>Less Obvious</b></p>
    
    <p>For a given carve radius, there is a pretty narrow range of speeds that will let you carve that path. 
    <ul>
        <li>Go too slow, and you'll be riding the sidewall, not the base. Or you will fall to the inside.
        <li>Go too fast, and the board will make the turn, but your body won't. 
        <li>You can cheat somewhat with angulation and skill, but you can only cheat for so long before the laws of physics catch up to you. You have a lot of flexiblity for quick course corrections, especially if you don't mind transitioning between carves and skids. But if you want to make sustained arcs? Newton's laws rule.
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you want to make highly inclined carves where your shoulders are skimming the snow, you might think that a tighter sidecut radius would be better. It turns more tighter and more tighter is more better, right? Not necessarily. When you lean way into a turn, with a tight sidecut, the board whips around in a very tight arc. With a 10m sidecut, it feels like my head stays still and my feet rotate around me. (That's not what really happens. I am exaggerating. But it really does feel that way.) With 13m or 15m sidecut radius, the arc is much larger. It feels more like snowboarding and less like acrobatics.</p>
