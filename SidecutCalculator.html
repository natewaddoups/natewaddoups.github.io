        <p>Work in progress... </p>
        <ul>
        <li>The math for the "trench" carve radius assumes that the board has zero taper.</p>
        <li>The math to calculate the speed for a balanced carve on deformable (trenched) snow has not yet been implemented.</p>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="chunk">    
    <p>Some relationships to bear in mind...</p>

    <p><b>Obvious</b></p>
    
    <p>For a given edge angle, a board with a shorter sidecut radius will (as you might expect) carve a tighter turn than a board with a longer sidecut radius.</p>

    <p>For a given sidecut radius and carve radius, there is only one edge angle that will make that board carve that radius. </p>

    <p>You can't carve a turn whose radius is larger than your board's sidecut radius. You can follow the path of such a turn, but you'll be skidding, not carving.</p>
    
    <p>If you ride a few boards with different radii, you'll find that shorter radius boards are best suited for lower speeds, and larger radius boards are best suited at higher speeds. 
    <ul>
        <li>Shorter radius boards carve tighter paths, and the faster you go, the more awkward it gets to carve tight turns - it's just easier to make bigger turns, which require low edge angles, and carving becomes impossible because the centripetal force pushes you out of the groove. 
        <li>Longer radius boards carve larger-radius paths, so the slower you go, the more awkward that gets. The board won't change direction quickly enough unless you use a very high edge angle, and at low speeds that just means you'll be riding the sidewall. So it's just easier to skid instead.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>So, if you're having trouble carving at higher speeds - or if you find yourself subconsciously slowing down before you start carving - a larger sidecut radius might be for you.</p>
    
    <p><b>Less Obvious</b></p>
    
    <p>For a given <i>carve radius</i>, there is a pretty narrow range of speeds that will let you carve that path. 
    <ul>
        <li>Go too slow, and you'll be riding the sidewall, not the base. Or you will fall to the inside.
        <li>Go too fast, and the board will make the turn, but your body won't. 
        <li>You can cheat somewhat with angulation and skill, but you can only cheat for so long before the laws of physics catch up to you. You have a lot of flexiblity for quick course corrections, especially if you don't mind transitioning between carves and skids. But if you want to make sustained arcs? Newton's laws rule.
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you want to make highly inclined carves where your shoulders are skimming the snow, you might think that a tighter sidecut radius would be better. It turns more tighter and more tighter is more better, right? Not necessarily. When you lean way into a turn, with a tight sidecut, the board whips around in a very tight arc. With a 10m sidecut, it feels like my head stays still and my feet rotate around me. (That's not what really happens. I am exaggerating. But it really does feel that way.) With 13m or 15m sidecut radius, the arc is much larger. It feels more like snowboarding and less like acrobatics.</p>

    <div class="chunk">

    <p>If you'd like to know more about the math behind the calculator, see <a href="http://alpinesnowboarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Physics-of-a-Snowboard-Carved-Turn.pdf">Physics of a carved snowboard turn</a>. 

    <p>For even more math, check out <a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/168379/1/carving.pdf">balanced carving turns in alpine skiing.</a>
        <p>If you find yourself thinking that sidecut depth and effective edge length matter more than sidecut radius, see Appendix A of that second paper. Spoiler: The math works out the same.
    </p>

    <p>If you are concerned about the accuracy of Howe's cosine formula, consider this quote from the 2nd paper:
        <blockquote>
            ...in the field study of turns performed by members of the Norwegian national team, Reid, Haugen, Gilgien, Kipp, and Smith (2020) found a good agreement with equation (33) up to Ψ ≃ 70◦
        </blockquote>
    "Equation 33" is Howe's cosine formula, and Ψ is just the edge angle.

    <p>You may have heard of an attempt to derive carve radius using finite-element-analysis. As noted above, it didn't align well with reality.</p>

    <p>A lot of people greatly over-estimate the role of board stiffness and/or effective edge length in determining sidecut radius. Those parameters do affect how well a board can hold a carve, but they have negligible effect on carve radius. </p>
    <p>I own two snowboards that are 170cm long and have 13m sidecuts, but the effective edge on one of them is very short - it's a powder board, and the tip and tail start to curve upward just past the bindings. Edge hold is not great on the powder board, but it's still capable of hip-dragging carves when the snow is good, and both boards carve the same paths.
    </div>

    <div class="chunk">
        <b>To give you a <i>very</i> rough idea of what boards tend to have what sidecuts...</b>
        <ul>
	<li>Freeride snowboards for soft-boot riding typically have a sidecut radius under 10 meters. This makes them agile at low speeds, but twitchy at high speeds.
        <li>Slalom hard-boot snowboards were typically around 10 meters.
        <li>Boardercross snowboards typically range from 10-13 meters or so. If you're looking for a soft-boot board that can carve big turns, look into this category - but look at the specs closely because they vary a lot.
        <li>Giant slalom snowboards are typically around 15-17 meters, however I've been seeing them with sidecuts of 18-20 meters lately.
        </ul>

	<P>The generalizations above are just generalizations.
        <br>All generalizations are false.
        <br>Hopefully those generalizations are helpful.
        <br>Check the specs before you buy.
